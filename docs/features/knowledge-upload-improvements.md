# Knowledge Upload Improvements — Enhanced Progress Tracking & Storage Integration

## Overview
- Enhanced `uploadAndIngest` function with complete `kb_ingest_jobs` field population
- Supabase Storage integration for file persistence and future background processing support
- Hybrid approach: immediate processing for small batches (≤5 files), future background queue for large batches (6+ files)
- Comprehensive progress tracking through all ingestion phases
- 7-day file retention policy with configurable cleanup strategy

## Problem Statement
Prior to these improvements, the upload system had several limitations:
- **Incomplete tracking**: `kb_ingest_jobs` records had null fields (`filename`, `storage_path`, `mime_type`, etc.)
- **No progress visibility**: Files jumped from "uploading" to "done" without intermediate steps
- **No file persistence**: Files were processed in-memory only, making background processing impossible
- **Poor error persistence**: Failed uploads disappeared on page refresh
- **No scalability path**: All processing was synchronous, blocking for large batches

## Implementation

### **Enhanced Progress Tracking**
The `uploadAndIngest` function now properly tracks all ingestion phases:

```typescript
// Phase progression with real database updates:
1. queued → uploading (10% progress)
2. uploading → extracting (40% progress) 
3. extracting → chunking (60% progress)
4. chunking → embedding (80% progress)
5. embedding → done (100% progress)
```

### **Complete Field Population**
All `kb_ingest_jobs` fields are now properly populated:

```typescript
{
  tenant_id: string,
  status: "queued" | "processing" | "done" | "error",
  step: "uploading" | "extracting" | "chunking" | "embedding" | "done" | "error",
  filename: string,
  mime_type: string,
  total_bytes: number,
  processed_bytes: number, // Updated throughout processing
  total_chunks: number,    // Set during chunking phase
  processed_chunks: number, // Updated during embedding
  allowed_roles: string[], // Defaults to ['admin']
  storage_path: string | null, // Supabase Storage path
  metadata: {
    originalFilename: string,
    uploadStartedAt: string // ISO timestamp
  }
}
```

### **Supabase Storage Integration**
Files are now saved to persistent storage for future background processing:

```typescript
// Storage path pattern: uploads/{tenantId}/{timestamp}-{sanitizedFilename}
const storagePath = `uploads/${tenantId}/${timestamp}-${sanitizedFilename}`;

await supabase.storage
  .from('knowledge-files')
  .upload(storagePath, buffer, {
    contentType: file.type,
    duplex: 'half'
  });
```

**Benefits:**
- Enables future background processing without re-upload
- Supports resumable uploads for large files
- Allows reprocessing of files if needed
- Provides audit trail of original files

### **File Lifecycle Management**
**Retention Policy:**
- **Successful uploads**: 7 days (for debugging and potential reprocessing)
- **Failed uploads**: 30 days (for troubleshooting)
- **Large files**: 1 day (to save storage costs)

**Cleanup Strategy:**
- Currently: Files preserved for 7 days (commented cleanup code ready for production)
- Future: Background job will handle automated cleanup based on retention policies

### **Hybrid Processing Approach**
The system now intelligently routes uploads based on batch size:

```typescript
if (files.length <= 5) {
  // Immediate processing - current system
  processFilesImmediately(files);
} else {
  // Future: Background queue processing
  // Currently: Process immediately with notification about future enhancement
  processFilesWithNotification(files);
}
```

**Decision Matrix:**
- **1-5 files**: Immediate processing, user stays on page
- **6+ files**: Future background processing, user can navigate away
- **50+ files**: Definitely requires background queue (enterprise use case)

## UI/UX Improvements

### **Persistent Error Display**
Error jobs now persist across page refreshes and remain visible in the upload queue until manually removed.

### **Enhanced File Actions**
- **Retry**: Failed uploads can be retried individually
- **Remove**: Files can be removed from queue (with database cleanup)
- **Progress**: Real-time progress bars show actual processing steps

### **Progress Visibility**
Users now see meaningful progress through actual processing phases instead of simulated progress.

## Database Schema Alignment

### **Updated kb_ingest_jobs Table**
```sql
ALTER TABLE kb_ingest_jobs 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS filename TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS storage_path TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS mime_type TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS metadata JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS allowed_roles TEXT[], -- NULL means inherit defaults
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS notes TEXT;
```

### **Removed Batch Complexity**
- Simplified schema by removing unused `kb_upload_batches` table
- Focused on individual file tracking with clear status progression
- Reduced complexity while maintaining full functionality

## Error Handling Improvements

### **Graceful Degradation**
- Storage upload failures don't block file processing
- Processing continues with `storage_path = null`
- Clear error logging without exposing sensitive data

### **Comprehensive Error States**
- Detailed error messages in `kb_ingest_jobs.error`
- Step-level error tracking (`step = "error"`)
- Audit logging for all failure scenarios

## Performance Considerations

### **Storage Impact**
- **Free Tier**: ~1GB storage limit
- **File Retention**: 7-day default balances debugging needs with storage costs
- **Configurable Cleanup**: Immediate deletion option available for storage-constrained environments

### **Processing Efficiency**
- No changes to core ingestion performance
- Enhanced tracking adds minimal overhead
- Supabase Storage upload runs in parallel with processing

## Environment Configuration

### **Required Storage Bucket**
```bash
# Supabase Storage bucket creation (manual setup required)
Bucket name: knowledge-files
Public: false
File size limit: 50MB (configurable)
Allowed MIME types: application/pdf, text/*, text/markdown, text/html
```

### **Optional Environment Variables**
```bash
# File retention configuration (future)
KNOWLEDGE_FILE_RETENTION_DAYS=7
KNOWLEDGE_CLEANUP_ENABLED=false

# Storage configuration
SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=knowledge-files
```

## Future Enhancements Enabled

This foundation enables several future improvements:

## Manual Test Plan

### **Basic Upload Flow**
1. Upload 1-3 PDF files → verify all `kb_ingest_jobs` fields populated
2. Check progress transitions: queued → extracting → chunking → embedding → done
3. Verify `storage_path` populated in database

### **Error Handling**
1. Upload password-protected PDF → verify error persists across refresh
2. Use retry button → verify file reprocesses successfully
3. Use remove button → verify database cleanup

### **Hybrid Logic**
1. Upload 3 files → verify immediate processing message
2. Upload 8 files → verify background processing notification
3. Confirm both scenarios work correctly

### **Storage Verification**
1. Check Supabase Storage bucket for uploaded files
2. Verify storage paths match database records
3. Confirm file retention according to policy

## Risk Mitigation
